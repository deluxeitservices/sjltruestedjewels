                        <h6>VAT on Bullion in the UK</h6>
                        <p>
                          In the United Kingdom, bullion products generally carry a 20% VAT (Value Added Tax). This rate has been consistent since 2025.                        </p>
                        <p>The key exception to this rule is investment gold, which has been exempt from VAT for many years. This exemption also extends across the wider European Union.</p>

                        <h6>Gold Bullion</h6>
                        <p>
                          At SLJ Trusted Jewels, our gold bars and coins are completely free from VAT, making them a straightforward investment option.
                        </p>

                        <h6>How the Gold Price is Set</h6>
                        <p>The global gold price is established through auctions run by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA).</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                             These auctions operate in short, timed rounds (usually 45 seconds).
                           </li>
                           <li>
                             After each round, the difference between the total demand and supply is measured.
                           </li>
                           <li>If that difference is larger than 20,000, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) continues the process with a new adjusted price until balance is reached.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This system ensures that the gold market remains transparent and stable.</p>

                        <h6>Why is Gold Free from VAT?</h6>
                        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee 100% security.</p>

                        <h6>5. Your Rights</h6>
                        <p>The exemption dates back to 1999, when the European Union decided to remove VAT from investment gold.</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Prior to this, some countries charged very little VAT as an incentive to attract buyers.</li>
                           <li>
                            Others, including the UK, charged full VAT, making them less competitive.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                            To create fairness across member states, VAT on gold was abolished.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          This reform took effect on 1 January 2000, and it continues to apply today.

                        <h6>Why Does Silver Still Have VAT?</h6>
                        <p>Silver is treated like an everyday purchase â€” much like buying a phone, a car, or a television.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>As such, silver bullion is subject to the standard 20% VAT.</li>
                          <li>Anyone investing in silver should be aware of this additional cost when making purchases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Important Note for Investors</h6>
                        <p>
                          If you are VAT-registered, you may be able to recover VAT paid on silver purchases. This depends entirely on your own circumstances, so professional advice is essential.

                          At SLJ Trusted Jewels, we are not financial advisors or accountants and therefore cannot provide individual guidance on VAT.
